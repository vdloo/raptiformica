Raptiformica
============

A self healing distributed infrastructure

Named after the formica sanguinea, an ant species of slave-makers that can
become self sufficient when necessary. These blood-red ants are also
haplometrotic, meaning an entire new colony can be founded by a single
fertilized, egg laying queen.
